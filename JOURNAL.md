| Arm Assistant | @Sam Atuatasi | A 3-axis robotic arm that can be controlled with real-life hand movements | 5/27/25 |

# May 27, 2025 - 3 hrs

Today was spent mainly research on other robotic arms and ways that people have made similair ideas. The three main ones I found most helpful were these:

This had the control that I was thinking of but i want to see if I can take this idea in a different direction:

Aside from that, I tried to make a pretty basic mockup of how the arm will look in onshape:

Tomorrow I'll probably start looking at materials, also whether I want to create my own PCB or use an Arduino/RasPi
