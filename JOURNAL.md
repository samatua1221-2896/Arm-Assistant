# June 6, 2025 - 8 hrs (over the past week)

It's been a while since I've really been able to sit down and work on my arm. I picked up a bunch of books from the library to look up the best possible processors to use for my project, eventually settling on a raspberry pi 3 B+ due to its bluetooth capabilities since I want to try and use a wireless X-Box controller as the main input for the arm. I've set up a tentative BOM, primarily sourcing everything from Amazon mainly because of the free shipping. This is the link below:

Next time I'll work on more of the CAD since I've pretty much locked down the type of motors I'm going to be using.

- Miuzei MG90S 9G Micro Servo Motor Metal Geared (3x)
- Iverntech 42 Nema 17 Stepper Motor 23mm Body for Titan Extruder 3D Printer 1.8 Stepper Angle 1.5A 2 Phase 4-Lead for base rotation
- WWZMDiB SG90 Micro Servo Motor for the hand gripper

Today was spent mainly research on other robotic arms and ways that people have made similair ideas. The three main ones I found most helpful were these:

This had the control that I was thinking of but i want to see if I can take this idea in a different direction:

Aside from that, I tried to make a pretty basic mockup of how the arm will look in onshape:

Tomorrow I'll probably start looking at materials, also whether I want to create my own PCB or use an Arduino/RasPi
